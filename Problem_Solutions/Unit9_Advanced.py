Problem 1: Croquembouche II
You are designing a delicious croquembouche (a French dessert composed of a cone-shaped tower of cream puffs ðŸ˜‹), for a couple's wedding. 
They want the cream puffs to have a variety of flavors. You've finished your design and want to send it to the couple for review.

Given a root of a binary tree design where each node in the tree represents a cream puff in the croquembouche, 
traverse the croquembouche in tier order (i.e., level by level, left to right).

You should return a list of lists where each inner list represents a tier 
(level) of the croquembouche and the elements of each inner list contain the flavors of each cream puff on that tier (node vals from left to right).

Note: The build_tree() and print_tree() functions both use variations of a level order traversal. 
To get the most out of this problem, we recommend that you reference these functions as little as possible while implementing your solution.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. 
Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. 
Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.

Hint: Level order traversal, BST

Problem 2: Icing Cupcakes in Zigzag Order
